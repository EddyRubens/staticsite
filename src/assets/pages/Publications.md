This thematic issue on Anthropology and Art presents critical reflections on the potentials for future collaborations in a field of sensory political/ecological art-ethnography, potentials for theoretical or practical collaborations as well as productive friction that infuse both activities with new political meaning and engagement and potentials for future complex collaborations in a field of social/political action. The editors have mixed contributions by artists, curators and anthropologists who all work in some way on these various subjects and have taken care to offer them maximum liberties to voice their perspectives.
